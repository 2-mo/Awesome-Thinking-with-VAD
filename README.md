## 🌟 Overview

This repository is a curated collection of research papers and resources exploring **thoughtful reasoning approaches** in Video Anomaly Detection (VAD), with a special focus on **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)**, and **Video Anomaly Understanding (VAU)**.

Video anomaly detection is evolving from simple frame-level alerts to systems that **reason, explain, and communicate** what makes something suspicious. This repository tracks that shift, focusing on methods that leverage **LLMs** and **VLMs** for deeper anomaly understanding.

**What's inside:**
- 📚 Conference & journal paper collections organized by venue and year
- 📊 Datasets categorized by LLM-readiness (explainable annotations vs. traditional labels)
- 🔗 Quick navigation to reasoning-centric VAD resources

**For:** researchers and practitioners exploring the intersection of anomaly detection, multimodal reasoning, and foundation models.

## 🧪 Benchmarks and Datasets

We maintain a comprehensive catalog of VAD datasets in **[dataset.md](dataset.md)**, organized by:

- 🤖 **LLM/VLM-Ready Datasets** — Multimodal & explainable annotations
  - Video-language annotation (UCA, VAD-Instruct50k, UCCD)
  - Cross-modal retrieval (UCFCrime-AR, XDViolence-AR)
  - Open-world understanding (UBnormal)
  - Large-scale multimodal (XD-Violence)

- 🔧 **Traditional VAD Benchmarks** — Classic deep learning datasets
  - Weakly supervised (UCF-Crime, ShanghaiTech-W, TAD)
  - Semi-supervised (UCSD, Avenue, ShanghaiTech, NWPU Campus)
  - Fully supervised (Hockey Fight, RWF-2000, CCTV-Fights)

- 🚗 **Domain-Specific** — Driving, traffic, and specialized scenarios
  - Honda HDD, ROADWork, MSAD
